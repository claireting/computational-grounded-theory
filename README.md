# Computational Grounded Theory
This code replicates the analysis done in the article Computational Grounded Theory: A Methodological Framework, currently under review.

01-Step1-PatternDetection replicates Tables 3-4.
02-Step2-PatternRefinement replicates Table 5.
03-Step3-PatternConfirmation replicates the analysis used in Step 3 of the paper.

The text is presented here sorted, rather than the complete text, as some of it is under copy right. As such this code replicates around 90% of the complete analysis. The final 10% requires the full text and requires interpretation on the part of the researcher, and is thus not fully replicable/reproducible.
